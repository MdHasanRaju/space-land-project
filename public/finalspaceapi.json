However, heâ€™s also very brave, kind, helpful, and very wise.Avocato also has a very dark past, he used to be the Lord Commander's right-hand who killed billions of people on a planet and killed the King and Queen of Ventrexia under his order."

His job was to keep Gary company and preserve his sanity, since Gary would spend those five years as the only human crew member of the ship. However, KVN's antics immediately made Gary develop a severe dislike for the robot, and this didn't change in the five years they spend together. Gary frequently expresses hostility towards him on a regular basis.For the next five years, he made Gary's time in the Galaxy One a living hell, thanks to his obnoxious personality, fully earning him Gary's hatred. Even H.U.E. admitted in Chapter 7 to have never liked KVN, considering him a jag-off."
